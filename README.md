# An-Introduction-to-Interactive-Programming-in-Python

Part of the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization »

This two-part course is designed to be a fun introduction to the basics of programming in Python. 
Main focus will be on building simple interactive games such as Pong, Blackjack and Asteroids. 

About the Course
This two-part course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of 
building simple interactive applications. Language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language 
that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a 
new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications 
will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.

The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through multiple "mini-projects" in Python. 
To make this class enjoyable, these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids. 

Course Format
The first part of the course will last five weeks.  The lectures from each week will focus on the topics listed in the syllabus 
while an associated weekly “mini- project” will serve to reinforce these concepts in practice.  Grades for these mini-projects 
will be determined via peer-assessment.  The class will also include two quizzes each week to provide further feedback.
